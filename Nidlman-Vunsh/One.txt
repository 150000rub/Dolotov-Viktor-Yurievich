Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management (ALCRM) servers
Adobe LiveCycleRights Management (ALCRM) servers let you define centralized policies to control access to
documents. The policies are stored on the ALCRM server. You require server access to use them.
ALCRM servers embed user access information in documents. Therefore, specify document recipients in ALCRM
policies. Alternatively, let the ALCRM server retrieve the list of recipients from LDAP directories.
Use ALCRM servers to set permissions for separate document tasks, for example opening, editing, and printing. You
can also define document auditing policies on ALCRM servers.

Setting up digital signature validation
When you receive a signed document, you may want to validate its signature(s) to verify the signer and the signed
content. Depending on how you have configured your application, validation may occur automatically. Signature
validity is determined by checking the authenticity of the signature’s digital ID certificate status and document integrity:
• Authenticity verification confirms that the signer's certificate or its parent certificates exist in the validator’s list of
trusted identities. It also confirms whether the signing certificate is valid based on the user's Acrobat or Reader
configuration.
• Document integrity verification confirms whether the signed content changed after it was signed. If content
changes, document integrity verification confirms whether the content changed in a manner permitted by the
signer.

Certify a PDF
When you certify a PDF, you indicate that you approve of its contents. You also specify the types of changes that are
permitted for the document to remain certified. For example, suppose that a government agency creates a form with
signature fields. When the form is complete, the agency certifies the document, allowing users to change only form
fields and sign the document. Users can fill the form and sign the document. However, if they remove pages or add
comments, the document doesn’t retain its certified status.
You can apply a certifying signature only if the PDF doesn’t already contain any other signatures. Certifying signatures
can be visible or invisible. A blue ribbon icon in the Signatures panel indicates a valid certifying signature. A digital
ID is required to add the certifying digital signature.
1 Remove content that may compromise document security, such as JavaScripts, actions, or embedded media.
2 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Certificates to open the panel.
3 Click one of the following options:
Places a certified signature in either an exiting digital signature field (if available) or in the
location you designate.

Note: If you enabled the When Signing: View Documents In Preview Mode in the Signature preferences, click Sign
Document in the document message bar.
5 Save the PDF using a different filename than the original file, and then close the document without making
additional changes. It is a good idea to save it as a different file so that you can retain the original unsigned
document.
Timestamp a document
Acrobat provides users with the capability to add a document timestamp to a PDF without also requiring an identitybased signature. A timestamp server is required to timestamp a PDF. (See Configure a timestamp server.) A timestamp
assures the authenticity and existence of a document at a particular time. These timestamps are compliant with the
timestamp and revocation features described in Part 4 of ETSI 102 778 PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures (PAdES)
standard. Users of Reader X (and later) can also timestamp a document if the document includes appropriate Reader
Enabling features.
For more information on PAdES, see blogs.adobe.com/security/2009/09/eliminating_the_penone_step_at.html
1 Open the document to which you want to add a timestamp.
2 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Certificates &amp;gt; Time Stamp.

Signature is timestamped but the timestamp could not be verified Timestamp verification requires obtaining the
timestamp server's certificate to your list of trusted identities. Check with your system administrator.
Signature is timestamped but the timestamp has expired Acrobat and Reader validate a timestamp based on the
current time. This message is displayed if the timestamp signer's certificate expires before the current time. To let
Acrobat or Reader accept an expired timestamp, select Use Expired Timestamps in the Signature Verification
Preferences dialog box (Preferences &amp;gt; Signatures &amp;gt; Verification: More). Acrobat and Reader display an alert message
when validating signatures with expired timestamp.
5 For details about the signer’s certificate, such as trust settings or legal restrictions of the signature, click Show Signer’s
Certificate in the Signature Properties dialog box.
If the document was modified after it was signed, check the signed version of the document and compare it to the
current version.
Remove a digital signature
You cannot remove a digital signature unless you are the one who placed it and you have the digital ID for signing it
installed.
Do one of the following:
• To remove a digital signature, right-click the signature field and choose Clear Signature.
• To remove all digital signatures in a PDF, choose Clear All Signature Fields from the options menu in the

3 When you’re done, close the temporary document.
Trust a signer’s certificate
Trusting a certificate involves adding it to the user’s trusted identity list in the Trusted Identity Manager and manually
setting its trust level. End users often exchange certificates as needed when using certificate security. Alternatively, they
add certificates directly from signatures in signed documents and then set trust levels. However, enterprises often
require employees to validate the signatures of others without performing any manual task. Acrobat trusts all
certificates for signing and certifying that chain up to a trust anchor. Therefore, administrators should preconfigure
client installations or let their end users add a trust anchor or anchors. For more information on trusting certificates,
see About certificate-based signatures.
PDF Portfolios and digital signatures
You can sign component PDFs within a PDF Portfolio, or sign the PDF Portfolio as a whole. Signing a component PDF
locks the PDF for editing and secures its content. After signing all the component PDFs, you can sign the entire PDF
Portfolio to finalize it. Alternatively, you can sign the PDF Portfolio as a whole to lock the content of all component
PDFs simultaneously.
• To sign a component PDF, see Sign PDF documents. The signed PDF is automatically saved to the PDF Portfolio.
• To sign a PDF Portfolio as a whole, sign the cover sheet (View &amp;gt; Portfolio &amp;gt; Cover Sheet). Once you sign the PDF
Portfolio as a whole, you cannot add signatures to the component documents. However, you can add more
signatures to the cover sheet.
Digital signatures on attachments to component PDFs
You can add signatures to attachments before signing the cover sheet. To apply signatures to attached PDFs, open the
PDF in a separate window. Right-click the attachment, and choose Open File from the context menu. To view
signatures on the PDF Portfolio, navigate to the cover sheet to view the document message bar and signatures pane.
Signed and certified PDF Portfolios
A properly signed or certified PDF Portfolio has one or more signatures that approve or certify the PDF Portfolio. The
most significant signature appears in a Signature Badge in the toolbar. Details of all signatures appear in the cover sheet.
• To view the name of the organization or person that signed the PDF Portfolio, hover the pointer over the Signature
Badge.
• To view details about the signature that appears in the Signature Badge, click the Signature Badge. The cover sheet

XML data signatures
Acrobat and Reader support XML data signatures that are used to sign data in XML Forms Architectures (XFA) forms.
The form author provides XML signing, validating, or clearing instructions for form events, such as button click, file
save, or submit.
XML data signatures conform to the W3C XML-Signature standard. Like PDF digital signatures, XML digital
signatures ensure integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation in documents.
However, PDF signatures have multiple data verification states. Some states are called when a user alters the PDFsigned content. In contrast, XML signatures only have two data verification states, valid and invalid. The invalid state
is called when a user alters the XML-signed content.
Establish long-term signature validation
Long-term signature validation allows you to check the validity of a signature long after the document was signed. To
achieve long-term validation, all the required elements for signature validation must be embedded in the signed PDF.
Embedding these elements can occur when the document is signed, or after signature creation.
Without certain information added to the PDF, a signature can be validated for only a limited time. This limitation
occurs because certificates related to the signature eventually expire or are revoked. Once a certificate expires, the
issuing authority is no longer responsible for providing revocation status on that certificate. Without conforming
revocation status, the signature cannot be validated.
The required elements for establishing the validity of a signature include the signing certificate chain, certificate
revocation status, and possibly a timestamp. If the required elements are available and embedded during signing, the
signature can be validated requiring external resources for validation. Acrobat and Reader can embed the required
elements, if the elements are available. The PDF creator must enable usage rights for Reader users (File &amp;gt; Save As Other
&amp;gt; Reader Extended PDF).
Note: Embedding timestamp information requires an appropriately configured timestamp server. In addition, the signature
validation time must be set to Secure Time (Preferences &amp;gt; Security &amp;gt;Advanced Preferences &amp;gt; Verification tab). CDS
certificates can add verification information, such as revocation and timestamp into the document without requiring any
configuration from the signer. However, the signer must be online to fetch the appropriate information.

Add verification information after signing
In some workflows, signature validation information is unavailable at signing, but can be obtained later. For example,
a company official may sign a contract using a laptop while traveling by air. The computer cannot communicate with
the Internet to obtain timestamping and revocation information to add to the signature. When Internet access is
available later, anyone who validates the signature can add this information to the PDF. All subsequent signature
validations can also use this information.
1 Ensure that your computer can connect to the appropriate network resources, and then right-click the signature in
the PDF.
2 Choose Add Verification Information.
Information and methods used to include this long term validation (LTV) information in the PDF comply with Part 4
of the ETSI 102 778 PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures (PAdES) standard. For more information, see
blogs.adobe.com/security/2009/09/eliminating_the_penone_step_at.html. The command is unavailable if the

Adobe Approved Trust List (AATL)
The Adobe Approved Trust List (AATL) allows users to create certificate-based signatures that are trusted whenever
the signed document is opened in Acrobat 9 or Reader 9 and later. Both Acrobat and Reader access an Adobe hosted
web page to download a list of trusted root digital certificates every 30 days. Any certificate-based signature created
with a credential that can trace a relationship back to a certificate on this list is trusted. The trusted root certificates have
been verified by Adobe and other authorities to meet specific technical requirements. They represent high assurance
identity and signing credentials. The certificates include government and citizen credentials from across the world. In
addition, they include credentials from global commercial certificate authorities and qualified certification service
providers (CSPs) in Europe.
For details about this feature and why it is important for validating a signature, see the AATL web page at
www.adobe.com/security/approved-trust-list.html.
AATL is enabled by default. The list downloads when you first open or create a signed document, or access the various
security preferences dialogs. You are asked to verify if the automatic update in the AATL is acceptable to you. Click Yes
if you want to receive the updates.
Note: Check with your administrator if your organization has turned off access to the AATL for some reason.
To verify the AATL is enabled:

Trust a signer’s certificate
Trusting a certificate involves adding it to the user’s trusted identity list in the Trusted Identity Manager and manually
setting its trust level. End users often exchange certificates as needed when using certificate security. Alternatively, they
add certificates directly from signatures in signed documents and then set trust levels. However, enterprises often
require employees to validate the signatures of others without performing any manual task. Acrobat trusts all
certificates for signing and certifying that chain up to a trust anchor. Therefore, administrators should preconfigure
client installations or let their end users add a trust anchor or anchors. For more information on trusting certificates,
see Certificate-based signatures.
PDF Portfolios and certificate-based signatures
You can sign component PDFs within a PDF Portfolio, or sign the PDF Portfolio as a whole. Signing a component PDF
locks the PDF for editing and secures its content. After signing all the component PDFs, you can sign the entire PDF
Portfolio to finalize it. Alternatively, you can sign the PDF Portfolio as a whole to lock the content of all component
PDFs simultaneously.
• To sign a component PDF, see Sign PDF documents. The signed PDF is automatically saved to the PDF Portfolio.
• To sign a PDF Portfolio as a whole, sign the cover sheet (View &amp;gt; Portfolio &amp;gt; Cover Sheet). Once you sign the PDF
Portfolio as a whole, you cannot add signatures to the component documents. However, you can add more
signatures to the cover sheet.
Certificate-based signatures on attachments to component PDFs
You can add signatures to attachments before signing the cover sheet. To apply signatures to attached PDFs, open the
PDF in a separate window. Right-click the attachment, and choose Open File from the context menu. To view
signatures on the PDF Portfolio, navigate to the cover sheet to view the document message bar and signatures pane.
Signed and certified PDF Portfolios
A properly signed or certified PDF Portfolio has one or more signatures that approve or certify the PDF Portfolio. The
most significant signature appears in a Signature Badge in the toolbar. Details of all signatures appear in the cover sheet.
• To view the name of the organization or person that signed the PDF Portfolio, hover the pointer over the Signature
Badge.
• To view details about the signature that appears in the Signature Badge, click the Signature Badge. The cover sheet
and the Signatures pane on the left open with details.
If the PDF Portfolio approval or certification is invalid or has a problem, the Signature Badge shows a warning icon. To
view an explanation of the problem, hover the pointer over a Signature Badge with a warning icon. Different warning
icons appear for different situations.
For a list and explanation of each warning, see the DigSig Admin Guide at www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_security_en.

XML data signatures
Acrobat and Reader support XML data signatures that are used to sign data in XML Forms Architectures (XFA) forms.
The form author provides XML signing, validating, or clearing instructions for form events, such as button click, file
save, or submit.
XML data signatures conform to the W3C XML-Signature standard. Like PDF digital signatures, XML digital
signatures ensure integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation in documents.
However, PDF signatures have multiple data verification states. Some states are called when a user alters the PDFsigned content. In contrast, XML signatures only have two data verification states, valid and invalid. The invalid state
is called when a user alters the XML-signed content.
Establish long-term signature validation
Long-term signature validation allows you to check the validity of a signature long after the document was signed. To
achieve long-term validation, all the required elements for signature validation must be embedded in the signed PDF.
Embedding these elements can occur when the document is signed, or after signature creation.
Without certain information added to the PDF, a signature can be validated for only a limited time. This limitation
occurs because certificates related to the signature eventually expire or are revoked. Once a certificate expires, the
issuing authority is no longer responsible for providing revocation status on that certificate. Without conforming
revocation status, the signature cannot be validated.
The required elements for establishing the validity of a signature include the signing certificate chain, certificate
revocation status, and possibly a timestamp. If the required elements are available and embedded during signing, the
signature can be validated requiring external resources for validation. Acrobat and Reader can embed the required
elements, if the elements are available. The PDF creator must enable usage rights for Reader users (File &amp;gt; Save As Other
&amp;gt; Reader Extended PDF).
Note: Embedding timestamp information requires an appropriately configured timestamp server. In addition, the signature
validation time must be set to Secure Time (Preferences &amp;gt; Security &amp;gt;Advanced Preferences &amp;gt; Verification tab). CDS
certificates can add verification information, such as revocation and timestamp into the document without requiring any
configuration from the signer. However, the signer must be online to fetch the appropriate information.

Add verification information at signing
1 Make sure that your computer can connect to the appropriate network resources.
2 Ensure that the preference Include Signature’s Revocation Status is still selected (Preferences &amp;gt; Signatures &amp;gt; Creation
&amp; Appearances: More). This preference is selected by default.
3 Sign the PDF.
If all the elements of the certificate chain are available, the information is added to the PDF automatically. If a
timestamp server has been configured, the timestamp is also added.

Electronic signatures
Add verification information after signing
In some workflows, signature validation information is unavailable at signing, but can be obtained later. For example,
a company official may sign a contract using a laptop while traveling by air. The computer cannot communicate with
the Internet to obtain timestamping and revocation information to add to the signature. When Internet access is
available later, anyone who validates the signature can add this information to the PDF. All subsequent signature
validations can also use this information.
1 Ensure that your computer can connect to the appropriate network resources, and then right-click the signature in
the PDF.
2 Choose Add Verification Information.
Information and methods used to include this long term validation (LTV) information in the PDF comply with Part 4
of the ETSI 102 778 PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures (PAdES) standard. For more information, see
blogs.adobe.com/security/2009/09/eliminating_the_penone_step_at.html. The command is unavailable if the
signature is invalid, or is signed with a self-signed certificate. The command is also unavailable in case the verification
time equals the current time.
